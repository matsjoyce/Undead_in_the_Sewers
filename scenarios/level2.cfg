Other than being considerably wetter than the first level (as though that were even possible), the two levels seem to be pretty similar. Lots of stone, brick, muck, and filthy water. And, of course, hordes of bloodthirsty undead.
There is one thing that's different about this level, however. Above the usual sounds of massive undead-infested sewers (drips, plops, growls, roars, screeches, clattering, groans, scratching, etc.), you can distinctly make out a low-pitched humming noise. It seems to be originating from the south-west."}
