No one knows, but one thing's for sure: they need to be removed as quickly as possible before they start causing trouble. The safety of many people's plumbing depends on you! Are you available? Can you help?

Undead in the Sewers! is an RPG campaign, and therefore differs in many ways from the standard Wesnoth campaign. You have a single playable character, and you cannot recruit or recall. There is also no economy, other than finding or earning gold by completing quests, which you can use to buy useful items (such as potions) from storekeepers.

Have fun!

(Intermediate level, complete, non-linear gameplay)"
